## Authorization Code Grant Flow
### âœ…This diagram represents the OAuth 2.0 Authorization code grant flow that mobile applications implement:

[1] The user starts the login flow by tapping the MyGoogleInfo Login button.

[2] Consequently, the app asks the authorization server to identify the user and ask their consent to access the data. The request includes a client_id so that the server can identify the app requesting the access.

[3] So, the authorization server redirects the user to its login screen (e.g. Google) and asks the userâ€™s consent to give the app access to the API.

[4] The user logs in and approves the request.

[5] If the user approves the access, the authorization server returns a grant code to the client.

[6] The client requests a token to the authorization server, passing its client_id and the received grant code.

[7] In response, the authorization server emits a token after verifying the client_id and the grant code.

[8] Finally, the client accesses the data to the resource server, authenticating its requests with the token.

### ðŸ’€Attacking the Authorization Code Grant Flow

Although the authorization code grant flow is the way to go for mobile apps, itâ€™s subject to client impersonation attacks. A malicious app can impersonate a legitimate client and receive a valid authentication token to access the user data.

For the flow diagram above, to receive a token the attacker should know these two parameters:

The appâ€™s client_id.
The code received in the callback URL from the authorization token.
Under certain circumstances, a malicious app can recover both. The appâ€™s client ID is usually hardcoded, for example, and an attacker could find it by reverse-engineering the app. Or, by registering the malicious app as a legitimate invoker of the callback URL, the attacker can also sniff the callback URL.

Once the attacker knows the client ID and the grant code, they can request a token to the token endpoint. From that point forward, they use the access token to retrieve data illegally.

### âœ…The following diagram depicts how PKCE strengthens the Authorization Code Grant flow in practice:

[1] This is where the login flow begins.

[2] On each login request, the client generates a random code (code_verifier) and derives a code_challenge from it.

[3] When starting the flow, the client includes the code_challenge in the request to the authorization server. On receiving the authorization request, the authorization server saves this code for later verification.

[7] The client sends the code_verifier when requesting an access token.

[8] Therefore, the authorization server verifies that code_verifier matches code_challenge. If these two codes match, the server knows the client is legit and emits the token.
